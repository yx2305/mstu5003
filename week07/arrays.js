// Big problem - Let's make a program that let's people choose an animal. Once an animal is chosen, then the computer will "make an appropriate animal sound to the console (pretend)"

// If I have an array like the following, what is the pseudocode logic to grab a random animal from the array? What does the random factor actually represent in the context of the array?
var animals = ["dog", "cat", "bird"];

// Make a function that returns a random animal.
// Make a function that will output to console, an appropriate sound for the animal that is passed into the function.

// Challenge - what if instead of outputting to a console, we wanted to actually make an MP3 sound output?
